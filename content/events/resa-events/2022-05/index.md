## About [DiveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io/)

[DiveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io/) (Diverse RSE) is a series of [talks and related activities](https://diverse-rse.github.io/) including discussion and panel sessions designed to support and raise awareness of EDI challenges and successes within the research software community.

## [DiveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io/): An Introduction
Supporting Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) within the Research Software Engineering community

The role title “Research Software Engineer” (RSE) was first used only around 10 years ago to describe individuals working in a research environment but focusing on building software. The Research Software Engineering movement started in the UK but has since spread around the world with international associations appearing in a number of countries.

As an open, friendly and welcoming community, there is enthusiasm for discussion about EDI challenges and successes. There have already been various examples within the community of events and related activties providing opportunities for discussing and understanding aspects of EDI.

ReSA is also collaborating with national research software engineering associations on [DiveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io/), a series of talks that provides a public forum to complement the [“Vive la différence - research software engineers” workshop](https://www.researchsoft.org/events/2022-04/).
