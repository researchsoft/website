        This 2.5-day workshop will bring together ~30 leaders in research software and AI to agree on a shared vision and co-develop a roadmap for how research software will be produced in the age of Generative AI – independent of today’s specific roles or job titles. 

        Through lightning talks, deep critique of a draft vision, and multiple rounds of focused working groups, participants will:

        * Explore future practices
        * Identify key risks and challenges
        * Design a short list of high-impact, near-term pilots (with resources, stakeholders, and success metrics). 

        The main outputs will be: 

        1. An agreed vision statement on future research software production
        2. A concise position paper
        3. A prioritized set of pilots and follow-up commitments to advance safe, reproducible, and effective use of Generative AI in research software and workflows.

        The invitation-only workshop will take place in March 2026 in Edinburgh, UK.
