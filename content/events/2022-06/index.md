## Research Software Community Leaders Forum 

The [Community Leaders Forum](https://www.researchsoft.org/events/2022-06/) (CLF) offers an opportunity for participants to meet other community leaders, engage in interactive discussions, and consider how to address common issues to achieve shared goals. The CLF is one of the online forums that ReSA hosts for decision makers and key influencers in the global research software community. ReSA aims to coordinate discussions across a wide range of research software organisations and programs, enabling the community to create outcomes that will achieve both local goals and those of the international community.

The CLF is open to everyone and features a short talk and follow-up discussion, with the aim of facilitating community consideration about next steps to address particular issues. We welcome input about topics for discussion. Please let us know if you’d like to suggest a topic for an upcoming call. 

Meetings occur at alternating times to maximise attendance by participants in different time zones. The CLF endeavours to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment, and to engage a broad range of participants from across the globe. Meetings utilise ReSA’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/). To help us plan accessible calls, please let us know any requirements you may have by contacting info@researchsoft.org.
