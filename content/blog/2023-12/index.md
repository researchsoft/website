The African continent is home to some of the world's most significant multi-country research projects. These projects often include research software and infrastructure development components, but it can be challenging to grasp the African research software and systems engineering (RSSE) landscape. This blog post shares information on ReSA’s activities to support RSSE in this region. It highlights the importance of having both a local community of practice where RSSEs can share their experiences and challenges, lessons learned, and solutions implemented *and* a global dialogue that includes African RSSEs as the RSSE movement matures, develops policies, and solidifies best practices. It concludes with a list of remarkable research projects and organisations that include RSSE components to illustrate how extensive and significant the African RSSE community is.

In 2023, [Talarify](https://www.talarify.co.za/) was appointed as the African Community Engagement Partner for the [Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/) (ReSA), with funding from a [grant](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7275397) through the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). As the  ReSA African Community Engagement Partner, we highlight information from the African community to enhance the visibility of local RSSE-related initiatives. We also share news, opportunities and resources from the ReSA community with African RSSEs and organisations involved in research software development through the channels listed below. We have spoken about the international Research Software Engineers (RSE) movement and ReSA’s work at various African forums, such as the inaugural [ZA-REN Week](https://events.tenet.ac.za/event/33/) (view the [presentation](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10013667)). We have also engaged with the global community to share African RSSE news through events such as the Annual Conference for Research Software Engineering (RSECon 2023) (view the [presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10013746)).

Our most significant contribution in the past six months was the first [African Research Software Indaba](https://rse-indaba.org) held in Cape Town, South Africa, in May 2023. The event covered discussions around four themes: 

- **Local RSSE initiatives** with presentations from [RSE@SUN](https://rse-at-sun.github.io/RSE-at-SUN/), [RSSE Africa](https://rsse.africa), and the [eLwazi Open Data Science Platform](https://elwazi.org/)
- **RSE movement, policy and funding** with presentations from Professor Simon Hettrick, Deputy Director of the UK [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) (SSI), and Dr Michelle Barker, Director of ReSA
- **Existing capacity and training** with a presentation from Dr Angelique Trusler, African Capacity Development Manager at [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and discussion led by Friedel Wolff, technical manager at the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org) (SADiLaR)
- **The next steps,** during which we identified some short- and medium-term activities, such as writing a paper to describe the local RSSE landscape and a follow-up meeting.

The 20 Indaba participants were primarily based in South Africa, but several are involved in projects that include other countries on the continent. They represented areas including bioinformatics, astrophysics, humanities and social sciences, high-performance computing, eResearch, IT, scientific computing, and open science. Read more about insights from the event in the [blog post](https://www.talarify.co.za/2023/05/29/driving-sustainable-research-software-and-systems-insights-from-the-first-research-software-indaba-in-africa/) and [report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7980634).

The Indaba enabled discussions on global as well as locally relevant topics. Participants could relate well to issues highlighted by international speakers whilst also articulating unique challenges and shared experiences related to local contexts. Challenges identified in the UK, Europe, the USA and elsewhere related to career prospects, recognition, limited training opportunities, isolation, and lack of communities of practice where lessons learned can be shared are also evident for RSSEs on the African continent.

One example of a local context that impacts the RSSE environment is load shedding. Load shedding happens when an electric utility cuts power to some customers due to a shortage of available electricity. This has been a common phenomenon across many African countries for years, but in 2023, load shedding reached a new high (or rather low!) in South Africa, increasing to [316/328 days](https://loadshed.theoutlier.co.za/) (at the time of writing) with shedding between two to twelve hours a day. Although the cost and accessibility of stable internet connections on research have been discussed for many years, the impact of interrupted power supply on data and computing centres has largely been hidden. Participants unanimously voiced their frustrations and concurred that the conversation to find workable solutions needed to be continued.

One regional initiative that plays a role in providing a local community of practice is RSSE Africa. The contract with ReSA enabled Talarify to allocate resources to continue supporting [RSSE Africa](https://rsse.africa), which was established in 2019 by Peter van Heusden and Eugene de Beste from the [South African National Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.sanbi.ac.za/) (SANBI). To support RSSE Africa, we have:

- redesigned (and continue to maintain) the [website](https://rsse.africa)
- created an [RSSE Africa LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12903402/)
- created an [RSSE Africa X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/RsseAfrica) account
- organised community meetups
- launched a [newsletter](https://rsse.africa/newsletters/) and 
- started a project to [spotlight African RSSEs](https://rsse.africa/project/spotlight/).

Talarify is looking forward to continuing working closely with ReSA, RSSE Africa, and various other global and local partners to amplify the voice of African RSSEs and create local awareness of existing resources, opportunities, communities, and more!

## <a name="_yoypd7mpba0n"></a>African Research Projects and Organisations with RSSE components

This list highlights some initiatives with significant RSSE components to help craft a better understanding of the tremendous role of RSSEs in Africa. This is by no means an exhaustive list. It excludes numerous outstanding and hugely impactful research initiatives across many countries (most notably those in Francophone, Arabophone, and Lusophone regions) and a wide variety of disciplines.

**Astronomy, Physics & Mathematics**

The [**African Institute for Mathematical Sciences**](https://centres.nexteinstein.org/) (AIMS) is a network of centres across Africa that promotes education and research in mathematical sciences, contributing to developing mathematical expertise on the continent.
