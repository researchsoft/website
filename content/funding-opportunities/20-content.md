# Research Software Funding Opportunities

ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. Members of the community can add current funding opportunities via this **[short form](https://forms.gle/r4Jw4swUd1SXigZc9)**. Funding opportunities are also posted in our [newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/), on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/researchsoft) and [Slack](https://researchsoft.slack.com/).

This database focuses on funding calls or programs that are **targeted at research software** and/or those who develop and maintain it (such as research software engineers). The database does not include broader funding calls for which research software is one of many options for investment, such as research projects in general, open science, open infrastructure, etc.
