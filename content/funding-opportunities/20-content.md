# Research Software Funding Opportunities

ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. Members of the community can add current funding opportunities via this **[short form](https://forms.gle/r4Jw4swUd1SXigZc9)**. Funding opportunities are also posted in our [newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/), on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/researchsoft) and [Slack](https://researchsoft.slack.com/).

This database focuses on funding calls or programs that are **targeted at research software** and/or those who develop and maintain it (such as research software engineers). The database does not include broader funding calls for which research software is one of many options for investment, such as research projects in general, open science, open infrastructure, etc.

The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.|Open-Source Ecosystems (OSEs), Managing Organizations, Societal Impact, Technology Solutions|USA|Current|
| US National Science Foundation (NSF) | Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) |<https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems> | 2025-04-22 | Vulnerabilities in an open-source product and/or its continuous development, integration and deployment infrastructure can potentially be exploited to attack any user (human, organization, and/or another product/entity) of the product. To respond to the growing threats to the safety, security, and privacy of open-source ecosystems (OSEs), NSF is launching the Safety, Security, and Privacy for Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) program. This program solicits proposals from OSEs, including those not originally funded by NSFâ€™s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program, to address significant safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities, both technical (e.g., vulnerabilities in code and side-channels) and socio-technical (e.g., supply chain, insider threats, and social engineering). | Open-Source Ecosystems (OSEs), Safety, Security, Privacy Vulnerabilities, Socio-Technical Threats | USA | Current |

The goal of this program element is to increase the accessibility, inclusivity, and reproducibility of the science from the parent award, to contribute back to the open-science communities relevant to the parent award, and/or provide cloud credits to further support or expand the parent award. To be eligible to propose to this program element, the proposer must have a research proposal that has been selected for funding. This program element does not have a proposal due date -- proposals may be submitted at any time, until 28 March 2025. | open-science communities, accessibility, inclusivity, reproducibility  | USA| Current|
