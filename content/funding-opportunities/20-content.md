# Research Software Funding Opportunities

ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. Members of the community can add current funding opportunities via this **[short form](https://forms.gle/r4Jw4swUd1SXigZc9)**. Funding opportunities are also posted in our [newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/), on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/researchsoft) and [Slack](https://researchsoft.slack.com/).

This database focuses on funding calls or programs that are **targeted at research software** and/or those who develop and maintain it (such as research software engineers). The database does not include broader funding calls for which research software is one of many options for investment, such as research projects in general, open science, open infrastructure, etc.

|US National Science Foundation (NSF)|Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)|<https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems>|2025-09-02|The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.|Open-Source Ecosystems (OSEs), Managing Organizations, Societal Impact, Technology Solutions|USA|Current|
| US National Science Foundation (NSF) | Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) |<https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems> | 2025-04-22 | Vulnerabilities in an open-source product and/or its continuous development, integration and deployment infrastructure can potentially be exploited to attack any user (human, organization, and/or another product/entity) of the product. To respond to the growing threats to the safety, security, and privacy of open-source ecosystems (OSEs), NSF is launching the Safety, Security, and Privacy for Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) program. This program solicits proposals from OSEs, including those not originally funded by NSF’s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program, to address significant safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities, both technical (e.g., vulnerabilities in code and side-channels) and socio-technical (e.g., supply chain, insider threats, and social engineering). | Open-Source Ecosystems (OSEs), Safety, Security, Privacy Vulnerabilities, Socio-Technical Threats | USA | Current |
|NASA - Science Mission Directorate (SMD) | ROSES-24 F.8 Supplements for Open-Source Science| <https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7BC1EE705E-34F3-1143-637F-3D4581EB5AF5%7D&path=open> |2025-03-28| Supplements for Open-Source Science solicits proposals to add an open science component to an existing "parent" ROSES award. The goal of this program element is to increase the accessibility, inclusivity, and reproducibility of the science from the parent award, to contribute back to the open-science communities relevant to the parent award, and/or provide cloud credits to further support or expand the parent award. To be eligible to propose to this program element, the proposer must have a research proposal that has been selected for funding. This program element does not have a proposal due date -- proposals may be submitted at any time, until 28 March 2025. | open-science communities, accessibility, inclusivity, reproducibility  | USA| Current|
|NASA - Science Mission Directorate (SMD)|ROSES-24 F.14 High Priority Open-Source Science|<https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7BF00E69A7-D2FB-8C27-6842-61D3C3C475D1%7D&path=open>|2025-03-28|SMD seeks proposals to support the Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI) and advance the goals of increasing transparency, accessibility, inclusion, and reproducibility of research in the SMD scientific community. This element supports proposals for two types of work: (1) the development of new technology to increase the accessibility, inclusivity, or reproducibility of SMD research, and (2) the development of capacity building materials to support the adoption of open science practices. A proposal only needs to address one of these development activities, though proposals that include both are welcome. Proposals may be submitted at any time until 28 March 2025, by which point the ROSES-2025 version of this program element should be open for proposal submission. Proposals submitted to this program element will be expected to complete the work within one year, with a typical size of ~$100,000 per award.|open-source science, new technology, capacity building materials|USA|Current|
|US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI)| Call for proposals for the URSSI Early-Career Fellowship Program | <https://urssi.us/blog/2024/11/22/call-for-proposals-for-the-urssi-early-career-fellowship-program/> | 2025-01-15 | The URSSI Fellowship, funded by the Sloan Foundation, supports early-career researchers in advancing scientific software sustainability. The program aims to drive innovation and foster lasting improvements within disciplinary and domain-specific practices. The fellowship focuses on projects that explore the role of AI in scientific software development, address best practices or persistent challenges in sustaining scientific software, and enhance the design and delivery of software training. This initiative aligns with URSSI's mission to improve the sustainability of scientific software in the US and leverages the creativity and expertise of early-career individuals to achieve impactful, long-term change. It is focused on PhD students, postdocs, research software engineers, and research scientists who are actively involved in scientific software development. | AI/ML Integration in Scientific Software Development, Scientific Software Sustainability, Software Education Research |US | Current|
| US-RSE | Community and Travel Funds program | <https://us-rse.org/funds-and-awards/> | 2024-12-31| US-RSE Community and Travel Funds program aims to grow and diversify the US-RSE community and larger RSE community; connect people within the US-RSE community; assist individuals to grow in their own career; increase visibility and viability of Research Software Engineering as a career; and create opportunities for underserved community members. Applications fall into two categories: 1) Community: These benefit a group of individuals within the community (e.g., hosting a regional group meetup) & 2) Individual: These benefit an individual applicant (e.g., travel reimbursement). This call supports US-RSE members in a variety of activities through funding from $100-$10,000 per proposal (with most expected to be up to $2,500). Applications are accepted on a quarterly basis. Closes 31 March (next application deadlines: 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December).| research software engineers, community, travel| Global | Current|
|Simons Foundation’s Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) |Scientific Software Research Faculty Award (SSRF) |<https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/scientific-software-research-faculty-award/>| 2024-12-05| The Simons Foundation invites applications for funding to support new research professor positions (e.g., “clinical professor,” “professor of practice” or “research professor,” the titles and roles depending on the university) in existing academic departments (the “host institutions”) to be filled by scientific software-focused researchers. The SSRF Award will support researchers who have a strong track record of leadership in scientific software development. The aim of this program is to stimulate the development and maintenance of core scientific software infrastructure in academic environments through creating a new, long-term, faculty-level career path.
