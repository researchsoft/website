Talarify joined the Research Software Alliance in February 2023 to help ReSA extend its reach to the broader international community â€” specifically Africa. The ReSA African Community Engagement role is funded through a grant from the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7275397).

The South African-based consulting company has been involved in numerous continental initiatives related to research software, including The Carpentries, Africa R Users, afrimapr and more. It has also been engaged in global Research Software Engineering initiatives such as the [International RSE Survey](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey) run by the UK Software Sustainability InstituteI since 2016. In 2022, Talarify led the monthly meetups for the African RSE community, better known as [RSSE-Africa](https://rsse.africa). It also supports the community by contributing to the RSSE Africa website, compiling a monthly newsletter, creating monthly member showcases, and more. Through their involvement in these initiatives, the Talarify team has learned much about the local communities and has established connections with researchers involved in coding and research infrastructure across the continent.

The Talarify team consists of Anelda van der Walt (Executive director), Nomalungelo Maphanga (Project manager and data science mentor), and Noxolo Chalale (Marketing and community engagement manager). Anelda has a background in Bioinformatics and 20 years of experience bridging the Global North and South contexts. Noma is qualified as a chemical engineer, codes in Python and R and is growing her research software skills. Noxolo brings expertise from more than ten years in media and digital marketing.

Talarify works with ReSA to create more awareness within the African research ecosystem about ReSA initiatives and opportunities whilst simultaneously advocating for recognition of African expertise in the global research software space.
