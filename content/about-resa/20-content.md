The vision of the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) is that research software and those who develop and maintain it are recognised and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide.

A [wide range](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08473) of research software organisations and programs exist internationally to address the varied challenges in
software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. ReSA aims to coordinate across these efforts to leverage investments, to achieve shared goals. The [ReSA Strategic Plan](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/Strategic_Plan_2021-23.pdf) provides details and a opportunity to [comment](https://github.com/researchsoft/website/discussions/5). The [ReSA engagement plan](https://zenodo.org/record/7714004#.ZAqaw-xBwU5) contains more information on how community engagement occurs. Also available is our [2022 year in review](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2023-02/) and [overview of ReSA](doi.org/10.54900/zwm7q-vet94!).


ReSA is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org/) and led by the ReSA [Steering Committee](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/). 

Members of the ReSA community are expected to adhere to the ReSA [Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/).
