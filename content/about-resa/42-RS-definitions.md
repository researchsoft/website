Research software is [defined](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068) by Barker et al (2022) in the [FAIR for Research Software Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) as including _â€œsource code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose. Software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not research software. This differentiation may vary between disciplines."_

The [roles of research software](https://doi.org/10.54900/xdh2x-kj281) have also been described by Rob van Nieuwpoort and Daniel S. Katz (2024) as follows:
