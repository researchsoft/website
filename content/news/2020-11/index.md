### 

The ReSA [Steering Committee](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/) is calling for nominations for 4 new members of the Steering Committee in 2021.
The ReSA Steering Committee is responsible for the strategic direction of ReSA. The role of the Steering Committee members is to provide strategic inputs to the development of ReSA, to achieve the ReSA vision that research software is recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide, and the mission to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of research software.

The ReSA Steering Committee will consist of 9 members in 2021, with the potential for some observer participants if determined relevant by the Steering Committee. ReSA Steering Committee Members are welcome from a broad diversity of individuals, disciplines of study, geographies, career stages and backgrounds, and are expected to have a broad understanding of, and a demonstrated commitment to research software or another relevant area such as open science.  

The ReSA Steering Committee decides on the frequency and mechanisms for its meetings, which are currently monthly at a time agreed to by the members. Legal responsibility is held by ReSA’s fiscal sponsors, [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/). The ReSA Committee will reflect the global and diverse perspectives of its community, and operate using inclusive participation practices. 

If you are interested in nominating yourself or someone else to be a ReSA Steering Committee member, then please fill out this **[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLhl_Vmtdd9Vuzb0Cf3_sry3F1OORpETIpWWwriHpIajJQhQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) by Fri 13 November 2020**. If you would like further information then please contact [Michelle Barker](mailto:michelle@researchsoft.org), Director, ReSA. The current Steering Committee will make decisions on membership but plans to move towards an open election in the future. Successful nominees will be contacted in December.
