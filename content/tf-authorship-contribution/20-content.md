The task force builds on [previous work](https://sdruskat.net/software-authorship/) to define criteria for software authorship and describe contribution types/roles in software. It aims to address

- a lack of community guidelines and criteria for software authorship;
- a lack of community support for any one existing contribution taxonomy/vocabulary for software.

### Roadmap

1. Examine relevant previous work
2. Draft definitions of software authorship and contributions
3. Facilitate expert and community review and consultation
4. Publish community guidelines
