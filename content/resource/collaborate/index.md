        ## Position papers

        The Research Software Alliance (ReSA) invites funders and partner organisations to co-author position papers, blog posts, and other publications that strengthen the visibility and understanding of key issues in research software. These collaborations provide the global research community with critical baseline data, insight into emerging challenges, and documentation of progress on strategic initiatives.
        
        
        ### By funding and co-developing these publications, your organisation will:
        
        
        
        * **Demonstrate global leadership** on critical issues facing the research software community, such as sustainability, policy alignment, and professional recognition
        * **Influence policy conversations** at international levels by amplifying your voice through ReSA’s global platform
        * **Extend your impact and visibility** through strategic dissemination to our networks and partners worldwide
        
        
        ### What you can co-create: 
        
        
        
        * **Position papers** that provide evidence, frame key challenges, and articulate strategic recommendations on issues 
        * **Blog articles and commentary** that connect policy, practice, and research communities
        * **Other publications** that support alignment across national and international initiatives
        

        ### Example collaboration: 
        
        Our co-authored position paper with the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, *"[Research Software is Critical to the Future of AI-Driven Research](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13350747)"*, exemplifies the reach and value of this collaboration opportunity:
        
        
        
        * Over **2,000 views** and **500 downloads** on Zenodo
        * Featured in [ReSA’s newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/) (550+ subscribers)
        * Shared with ReSA’s [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/research-software-alliance/) audience (800+ followers) and other social media ([Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/researchsoftware.bsky.social), [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/researchsoft/shared_invite/zt-1flmrglww-SoWjAK_5TJyqLU_~Jx697w))
        * **Cross-posted by partners** (e.g., Software Sustainability Institute, Netherlands eScience Center, EVERSE, US-RSE), extending reach internationally 
        
        This paper demonstrated Canada’s leadership in aligning AI strategy with research software policy—and helped shape the global conversation.
        
        
        ### We invite co-authors to collaborate on upcoming pieces exploring themes such as:
        
        
        
        * AI for research software engineering (RSEng)
        * Metascience of RSEng
        * Research assessment reform and its implications for RSEs
        
        
        ### Investment and timeline:
        
        
        
        * **USD $15,000 per paper**
        * **3-month timeline**
        * Support includes collaborative authorship, stakeholder input, editing, and global promotion
        
        ReSA brings together decision-makers and influencers across the international research software community. Join us to extend your impact and advance shared goals in the global research community.
