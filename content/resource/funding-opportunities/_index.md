        ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. **This database is no longer being actively maintained or updated, so some information may be out of date and new funding opportunities are not being added.** Current funding opportunities are shared via our [newsletter](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/research-software-alliance/), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@researchsoft), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/researchsoftware.bsky.social), and [Slack](https://researchsoft.slack.com/).
    
        This database focuses on funding calls or programs that are **targeted at research software** and/or those who develop and maintain it (such as research software engineers). The database does not include broader funding calls for which research software is one of many options for investment, such as research projects in general, open science, open infrastructure, etc.
