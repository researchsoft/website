        * **Global cohesion**: Highlight cross-border, cross-sector, and cross-discipline collaboration to build new bridges across the global research software landscape  
        * **Community connection**: Showcase stakeholder stories, collaboration highlights, and best practices to connect with peers and unite efforts  
        * **Strategic impact**: Influence funding, policy, and research priorities; and showcase leadership within the research software community and broader movements, including open science, FAIR, research assessment reform, and open source.
