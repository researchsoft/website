        IRSC 2026 will bring together global leaders and change-makers working to advance strategic coordination, long-term sustainability, and high-level collaboration across the research software community. Aimed at those who support and develop research software, including RSE associations, research infrastructures, universities, funders, policymakers, publishers, and communities advancing open science, open source, research assessment, training, and related initiatives, the program will feature community challenge–driven sessions, invited talks and panels, and an open call for sessions supporting mutual learning.
