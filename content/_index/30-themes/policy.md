* Establishment of [Research Software Funders Forum](https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum).
* [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability (ADORE.software)](https://adore.software/) aims to raise awareness of the role of funding practice in the sustainability of research software, and to improve that practice.
* The joint ReSA [task force](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) and [FORCE11](https://force11.org/) working group on Code Availability is working towards greater alignment on policy and other related actions for code availability.
* [Policies in Research Organisations for Research Software (PRO4RS)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/policies-research-organisations-research-software-pro4rs) is a joint working group with the [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) to help build our collection of [institutional policies](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/) and consider how to better share these with interested stakeholders.
* Development of research software sharing guidelines for policy makers, funders, publishers and researchers in the [Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-covid19-rda-covid19-omics-rda-covid19-epidemiology-rda-covid19-clinical-rda-covid19-1).
