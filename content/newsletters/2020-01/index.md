We are also delighted to announce that ARDC are providing some in kind funding to support ReSA, which is enabling ARDC's Matthias Liffers to support the ReSA Taskforces. Welcome, Matthias!

### Events

A session on "FAIR principles for research software" will be held at the next Research Data Alliance Plenary in Melbourne: https://www.rd-alliance.org/fair-principles-research-software This builds on the discussion started by the paper "Towards FAIR principles for research paper" https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026 and will include discussion of forming a ReSA Taskforce / WG on FAIR software, in partnership with RDA and FORCE11. Remote participation is available.

NL-RSE (The Netherlands Research Software Engineer Community) are organising regular meetups to encourage collaboration and communication between Research Software Engineers in the Netherlands. The meetings are organized at the fantastic facilities of SURF in Utrecht. This venue is less than 5 minutes walking distance from the central railway station in Utrecht, direction of Hoog Catharijne. https://nl-rse.org/pages/meetups.html
