      title: Software Matters
      text: |
        Research software is recognised as critical to research outcomes. As early as 2014, a [UK survey](https://zenodo.org/records/14809) of 1,000 randomly chosen researchers showed that more than 90% of researchers acknowledged software as being important for their own research, and about 70% of researchers said that their research would not be possible without software. A study of [Nature papers from Jan-March 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8109183) reveals that “32 of the 40 papers examined mention software, and the 32 papers contain 211 mentions of distinct pieces of software, for an average of 6.5 mentions per paper.” [2].

        Research software is also critical in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven research, and the technological infrastructure to support AI acceleration must include research software and its personnel. Read our [position paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13350747) on this vital part of AI infrastructure, which includes recommendations for stakeholders on how to consider research software in their AI goals.
