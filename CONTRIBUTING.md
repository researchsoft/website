# Contributing to ReSA website

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the ReSA website, which is hosted in the [ReSA Organization](https://github.com/researchsoft) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

This guide is inspired from [Atom's contributing guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Research Software Alliance. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/researchsoft/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. To report a bug, create an issue in the [website repository](https://github.com/researchsoft/website) by filling in the [bug report template](https://github.com/researchsoft/website//issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Cneeds+triage&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=BUG%3A+).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the probelem:

* **Use clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** n as many details as possible. For example: which command do you use in the terminal or in GitHub browser. Explain **how you did different steps, in addition to what you did**. For example: if you moved your cursor to next line, please mention if you used the mouse, or a keyboard button or a programming command in an IDE or GitHub browser. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable text or code.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after followig the steps** and point out the exact problem in that behaviour/output.
* **Explain what behaviour you expected to see instead and why**.
* **Include screenshots or animated GIF/video** which show how you followed the steps and clearly demonstrate the problem in the output you observe.

Provide more context by answering the following questions:

* Can you reproduce the problem on another branch?
* Did the problem started happening recently i.e. in the new website (i.e. when theme is beautifulhugo) or was this a problem in the older version too (i.e. when theme is Syna)?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, please describe how often the problem occurs and under what conditions does it normally occur.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening or editing files), **does the problem occur for all the files and folders?** Does the problem occur only when working with local or remote files (e.g., on network drives), with specific type of file (e.g. .md or .html, etc.), with files with large size, with files with more number of lines, with files with a specific encoding? It there anything else specific about the files you are using?
