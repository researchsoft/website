# Contributing to ReSA website

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the ReSA website, which is hosted in the [ReSA Organization](https://github.com/researchsoft) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

This guide is inspired from [Atom's contributing guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Research Software Alliance. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/researchsoft/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. To report a bug, create an issue in the [website repository](https://github.com/researchsoft/website) by filling in the [bug report template](https://github.com/researchsoft/website//issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Cneeds+triage&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=BUG%3A+).
